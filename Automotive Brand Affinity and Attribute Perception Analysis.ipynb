    "1. Audi and BMW have the highest lift values for engine-related positive comments, indicating that customers particularly appreciate their engine quality or performance. Honda has a notably lower lift value, suggesting less association with engine quality in positive sentiments.\n",

    "2. Lexus and Audi leads significantly in positive associations with interior. This indicates that when people make positive comments, they often highlight the interior quality of these brands. Acura and BMW have lower lift values, suggesting this may not be a standout attribute in positive mentions.\n",

    "3. Lexus has the highest lift value for luxury, reinforcing its image as a luxury brand in the minds of consumers. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Honda stands out with the highest lift value for performance, suggesting that positive sentiments about Honda frequently reference its performance. This is interesting as it contrasts with the lower lift value for the engine, indicating that Honda's overall performance is appreciated beyond just the engine.\n",

    "5. Honda has the highest lift value for price, which may indicate that customers feel the pricing of Honda cars is well-justified or they see great value in the brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Business Implications</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Marketing Strategy: Marketing efforts should align with these strengths. Lexus can focus on their luxury status, while Honda can highlight their performancece in advertising campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Brand Positioning: Lexus should continue to position itself in the luxury segment, leveraging its strong association with luxury in customer sentiments. Honda's emphasis could be on the performance aspect, differentiating itself from competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pricing Communication: Honda's high lift value for price indicates that their pricing is seen as favorable. Honda can capitalize on this by promoting its cars as offering excellent 'performance' for money. Audi and BMW should ensure their pricing strategies are transparent and communicate the value customers receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Customer Experience: For brands with lower lift values in certain attributes, such as Acura and BMW's interior, there may be opportunities to improve customer experience in these areas or to communicate existing quality more effectively.\n",
